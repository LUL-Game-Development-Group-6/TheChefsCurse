# The Chef's Curse 🍔🔪

An insanely fun **roguelike** game made in Java (libGDX framework) as group project for University.

## Game Description 🍿
In a world where sciece has taken over, scientists managed to make food come to life. The mutations,
specifically in junk food, have evolved into a serious problem for society and humans are in danger of being destroyed.
Lucky for us, **Giorgio** 🇮🇹, our main character, is an experienced cheff and great fighter 🔫. This makes him the best candidate to erradicate 
this greater good. People say he has been **_"cursed"_** to solve this problem on his own.

Giorgio will traverse different rooms where he will have to clear all the enemies that will try to kill him to progress to the next round.
